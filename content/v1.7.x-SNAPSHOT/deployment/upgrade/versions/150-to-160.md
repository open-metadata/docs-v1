# Upgrade from 1.5.x to 1.6.x

Upgrading from version 1.5.x to 1.6.x can be executed directly on your instances. Below are important details and considerations for a smooth upgrade process.


## Deprecation Notice

## Breaking Changes in 1.6.x Stable Release

### View Lineage Transition to Lineage Workflow

The View Lineage feature has been relocated to the Lineage Workflow. This adjustment aims to enhance user experience and streamline access to lineage information.

#### Key Changes in YAML Configuration

As part of this upgrade, please note the modifications required in your YAML files for metadata ingestion:

- The `overrideViewLineage` configuration has been deprecated in the DatabaseMetadata source configuration.

#### Old Configuration Example

```yaml
    ....
    sourceConfig:
        config:
            type: DatabaseMetadata
            .....
            overrideViewLineage: true # deprecated
            .....
```

#### New Configuration Requirement
The `overrideViewLineage` setting will now be part of the DatabaseLineage configuration within the Lineage Workflow:


```yaml
    ....
    sourceConfig:
        config:
            type: DatabaseLineage
            .....
            lineageInformation:
                overrideViewLineage: true
            .....
```
