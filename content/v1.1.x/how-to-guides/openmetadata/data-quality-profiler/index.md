# Overview of Data Quality and Profiler

With OpenMetadata, you can build trust in your data by creating tests to monitor that the data is complete, fresh, and accurate. The data profiler helps to capture table usage statistics over a period of time. This happens as part of profiler ingestion. Data profiles enable you to check for null values in non-null columns, for duplicates in a unique column, etc. You can gain a better understanding of column data distributions through the descriptive statistics provided.
