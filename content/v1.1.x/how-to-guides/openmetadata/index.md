# The Six Pillars of OpenMetadata

OpenMetadata is an all-in-one platform for data discovery, lineage, data quality, observability, governance, and team collaboration. Powered by a centralized metadata store based on Open Metadata Standards/APIs, supporting connectors to a wide range of data services, OpenMetadata enables end-to-end metadata management, giving you the freedom to unlock the value of your data assets.

OpenMetadata is a complete package for data teams to break down team silos, share data assets from multiple sources securely, collaborate around data, and build a documentation-first data culture in the organization.

2. Data Collaboration,
