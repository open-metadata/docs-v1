# How to Follow a Data Asset

Users can get timely information about all the **activities**, **announcements**, and **feeds** related to a data asset by following those assets. The owners of the data assets will receive all the updates by default. The follow option can be used for the assets that you do not own. Data asset owners have more access to edit the assets, whereas followers can only **rate** the data assets, and not edit them.

To follow a data asset, 
- Navigate to the **Explore** page.
- Select the relevant type of data asset (Tables, Topics, Dashboards, Pipelines, ML Models, and Containers).
- Select a data asset.
