# How to Add Description using Markdown

Description allows you to document the data to help data consumers understand it. In OpenMetadata, the search option also searches based on the text in the description. You can also document nested columns and search based on the descriptions. You can tag the columns using glossary terms to add semantic meaning. You can add classification tags to classify the data. You can set business importance of data by setting Tier. Tier 1 is the most important data of an organization. All the descriptive metadata you add in the form of description, ownership, and tier are available in Search and Explore.

In OpenMetadata, you can work around the data asset descriptions in one of the following ways:
- Add or edit description
- Request for description
- Start a conversation around the description

## Add or Edit Description
- From the Explore page, navigate to the data asset you would like to edit.
