# Manage Teams and Users

OpenMetadataâ€™s versatile hierarchical team structure helps align with your organization's setup. Admins can mirror their organizational hierarchy by creating various team types. You can onboard new users to the relevant teams. An organization can have multiple Admins, so that different teams and departments can be effectively managed by separate Admins.

# Team Structure in OpenMetadata

In OpenMetadata we have hierarchal team structure with `teamType` that can be `Organization`, `Business Unit`, `Division`, `Department`, and `Group` (default team type).

- `Organization` is the root team in the hierarchy. _It can't have a parent_. It can have children of type `Business Unit`, `Division`, `Department`, `Group` along with `Users` directly as children (who are without teams).

- `BusinessUnit` is the next level of the team in the hierarchy. It can have `Business Unit`, `Division`, `Department`, and `Group` as children. It can only have **one parent** either of type `Organization`, or `Business Unit`.

- `Division` is the next level of the team in the hierarchy below `Business Unit`. It can have `Division`, `Department`, and `Group` as children. It can only have **one parent** of type `Organization`, `Business Unit`, or `Division`.

- `Department` is the next level of the team in the hierarchy below `Division`. It can have `Department` and `Group` as children. It can have `Organization`, `Business Unit`, `Division`, or `Department` as parents. **It can have multiple parents**.

- `Group` is the last level of the team in the hierarchy. It can have only `Users` as children and not any other teams. It can have all the team types as parents. **It can have multiple parents**.
