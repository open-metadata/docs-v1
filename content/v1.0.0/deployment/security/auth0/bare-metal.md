# Auth0 SSO for Bare Metal

## Update conf/openmetadata.yaml

Once the `Client Id` and `Client Secret` are generated add the `Client Id` in `openmetadata.yaml` file in `client_id` field.

```yaml
authenticationConfiguration:
  provider: "auth0"
  publicKeyUrls: 
    - "https://parth-panchal.us.auth0.com/.well-known/jwks.json"
    - "http://openmetadata:8585/api/v1/system/config/jwks"
  authority: "https://parth-panchal.us.auth0.com/"
  clientId: "{Client ID}"
  callbackUrl: "http://localhost:8585/callback"
```

{% note noteType="Warning" %}

It is important to leave the publicKeys configuration to have both Auth0 public keys URL and OpenMetadata public keys URL. 

1. Auth0 SSO Public Keys are used to authenticate User's login
2. OpenMetadata JWT keys are used to authenticate Bot's login
3. Important to update the URLs documented in below configuration. The below config reflects a setup where all dependencies are hosted in a single host. Example openmetadata:8585 might not be the same domain you may be using in your installation.
4. OpenMetadata ships default public/private key, These must be changed in your production deployment to avoid any security issues.

For more details, follow [Enabling JWT Authenticaiton](deployment/security/enable-jwt-tokens)

Then, 
- Update `authorizerConfiguration` to add login names of the admin users in `adminPrincipals` section as shown below.
- Update the `principalDomain` to your company domain name.

```yaml
authorizerConfiguration:
  className: "org.openmetadata.service.security.DefaultAuthorizer"
  # JWT Filter
  containerRequestFilter: "org.openmetadata.service.security.JwtFilter"
  adminPrincipals:
    - "user1"
    - "user2"
  principalDomain: "open-metadata.org"
```
