# Upgrade from 0.13 to 1.0

Upgrading from 0.13 to 1.0 can be done directly on your instances. This page will list few general details you should take into consideration when running the upgrade.

## 1.0.0 Highlights

### Service Connection Updates

- Postgres:
  - The database field for `Postgres` connector has been made a required field as initial database is required to connect to Postgres.
  - `Ingest All Database` field has been added since earlier when database field was empty we were ingesting all the databases but since now we have made the database field required you need to enable `Ingest All Database` flag in case you want to ingest all the available database in OpenMetadata.

- BigQuery:
  - Removed: `partitionQueryDuration`, `partitionQuery` & `partitionField`
    - since these fields are not used during the ingestion and has already being moved to profiler hence we have removed these fields.

- Salesforce:
  - Removed: `scheme`, `hostPort`, `supportsProfiler` & `supportsQueryComment`
    - These fields are related to a SQLAlchemy based connector and since `Salesforce` is based on APIs and not SQLAlchemy, these fields has been removed

- Superset:
    - Removed: `connectionOptions`
        - This field was not being used anywhere, hence removed.
