# Run Connectors from MWAA

When running ingestion workflows from MWAA we have two main approaches:
1. Install the oprenmetadata-ingestion package as a requirement in the Airflow environment. We will then run the process using a `PythonOperator`
2. Configure an ECS cluster and run the ingestion as an `ECSOperator`.
3. Install the PythonVirtualenvOperator in the MWAA environment and run the ingestion process in a virtualenv.

We will now discuss pros and cons of each aspect and how to configure them.

## Ingestion Workflows as a Python Operator

### PROs

- It is the simplest approach
- We donâ€™t need to spin up any further infrastructure

### CONs

- We need to install the [openmetadata-ingestion](https://pypi.org/project/openmetadata-ingestion/) package in the MWAA environment
- The installation can clash with existing libraries
- Upgrading the OM version will require to repeat the installation process

To install the package, we need to update the `requirements.txt` file from the MWAA environment to add the following line:

```
openmetadata-ingestion[<plugin>]==x.y.z
```

Where `x.y.z` is the version of the OpenMetadata ingestion package. Note that the version needs to match the server version. If we are using the server at 0.12.2, then the ingestion package needs to also be 0.12.2.

The plugin parameter is a list of the sources that we want to ingest. An example would look like this `openmetadata-ingestion[mysql,snowflake,s3]==0.12.2.2`.

A DAG deployed using a Python Operator would then look like follows

```python
import json
from datetime import timedelta

from airflow import DAG

try:
    from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
except ModuleNotFoundError:
    from airflow.operators.python_operator import PythonOperator

from airflow.utils.dates import days_ago

from metadata.ingestion.api.workflow import Workflow

default_args = {
    "retries": 3,
    "retry_delay": timedelta(seconds=10),
    "execution_timeout": timedelta(minutes=60),
}

config = """
YAML config
"""

def metadata_ingestion_workflow():
    workflow_config = json.loads(config)
    workflow = Workflow.create(workflow_config)
    workflow.execute()
    workflow.raise_from_status()
    workflow.print_status()
    workflow.stop()

with DAG(
    "redshift_ingestion",
    default_args=default_args,
    description="An example DAG which runs a OpenMetadata ingestion workflow",
    start_date=days_ago(1),
    is_paused_upon_creation=False,
    catchup=False,
) as dag:
    ingest_task = PythonOperator(
        task_id="ingest_redshift",
        python_callable=metadata_ingestion_workflow,
    )
```

Where you can update the YAML configuration and workflow classes accordingly. accordingly. Further examples on how to 
run the ingestion can be found on the documentation (e.g., [Snowflake](https://docs.open-metadata.org/connectors/database/snowflake)).

### Extracting MWAA Metadata

As the ingestion process will be happening locally in MWAA, we can prepare a DAG with the following YAML
configuration:

```yaml
source:
  type: airflow
  serviceName: airflow_mwaa
  serviceConnection:
    config:
      type: Airflow
      hostPort: http://localhost:8080
      numberOfStatus: 10
      connection:
        type: Backend
  sourceConfig:
    config:
      type: PipelineMetadata
sink:
  type: metadata-rest
  config: {}
workflowConfig:
  loggerLevel: INFO
  openMetadataServerConfig:
    hostPort: <OpenMetadata host and port>
    authProvider: <OpenMetadata auth provider>
```

Using the connection type `Backend` will pick up the Airflow database session directly at runtime.

## Ingestion Workflows as an ECS Operator

### PROs
- Completely isolated environment
- Easy to update each version

### CONs
- We need to set up an ECS cluster and the required policies in MWAA to connect to ECS and handle Log Groups.

We will now describe the steps, following the official AWS documentation.

### 1. Create an ECS Cluster

- The cluster just needs a task to run in `FARGATE` mode.
- The required image is `docker.getcollate.io/openmetadata/ingestion-base:x.y.z`
  - The same logic as above applies. The `x.y.z` version needs to match the server version. For example, `docker.getcollate.io/openmetadata/ingestion-base:0.13.2`
  
We have tested this process with a Task Memory of 512MB and Task CPU (unit) of 256. This can be tuned depending on the amount of metadata that needs to be ingested.

When creating the ECS Cluster, take notes on the log groups assigned, as we will need them to prepare the MWAA Executor Role policies.

### 2. Update MWAA Executor Role policies

- Identify your MWAA executor role. This can be obtained from the details view of your MWAA environment.
- Add the following two policies to the role, the first with ECS permissions:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ecs:RunTask",
                "ecs:DescribeTasks"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Action": "iam:PassRole",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ],
            "Condition": {
                "StringLike": {
                    "iam:PassedToService": "ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```


And for the Log Group permissions

```json
{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
        "logs:CreateLogStream",
        "logs:CreateLogGroup",
        "logs:PutLogEvents",
        "logs:GetLogEvents",
        "logs:GetLogRecord",
        "logs:GetLogGroupFields",
        "logs:GetQueryResults"
    ],
    "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:logs:<region>:<account-id>:log-group:<airflow-environment-name->*",
        "arn:aws:logs:*:*:log-group:<ecs-mwaa-group>:*"
    ]
}
                
```

Note how you need to replace the `region`, `account-id` and the `log group` names for your Airflow Environment and ECS.

A DAG created using the ECS Operator will then look like this:

```python
from datetime import datetime

import yaml
from airflow import DAG

from http import client
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.providers.amazon.aws.operators.ecs import ECSOperator
from airflow.utils.dates import days_ago
import boto3


CLUSTER_NAME="openmetadata-ingestion-cluster"  # Replace value for CLUSTER_NAME with your information.
CONTAINER_NAME="openmetadata-ingestion"  # Replace value for CONTAINER_NAME with your information.
LAUNCH_TYPE="FARGATE"

config = """
YAML config
"""


with DAG(
    dag_id="ecs_fargate_dag",
    schedule_interval=None,
    catchup=False,
    start_date=days_ago(1),
    is_paused_upon_creation=True,
) as dag:
    client=boto3.client('ecs')
    services=client.list_services(cluster=CLUSTER_NAME,launchType=LAUNCH_TYPE)
    service=client.describe_services(cluster=CLUSTER_NAME,services=services['serviceArns'])
    ecs_operator_task = ECSOperator(
        task_id = "ecs_ingestion_task",
        dag=dag,
        cluster=CLUSTER_NAME,
        task_definition=service['services'][0]['taskDefinition'],
        launch_type=LAUNCH_TYPE,
        overrides={
            "containerOverrides":[
                {
                    "name":CONTAINER_NAME,
                    "command":["python", "main.py"],
                    "environment": [
                      {
                        "name": "config",
                        "value": config
                      },
                      {
                        "name": "pipelineType",
                        "value": "metadata"
                      },
                    ],
                },
            ],
        },

        network_configuration=service['services'][0]['networkConfiguration'],
        awslogs_group="/ecs/ingest",
        awslogs_stream_prefix=f"ecs/{CONTAINER_NAME}",
    )
```

Note that depending on the kind of workflow you will be deploying, the YAML configuration will need to updated following 
the official OpenMetadata docs, and the value of the `pipelineType` configuration will need to hold one of the following values:

- `metadata`
- `usage`
- `lineage`
- `profiler`
- `TestSuite`

Which are based on the `PipelineType` [JSON Schema definitions](https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/blob/main/openmetadata-spec/src/main/resources/json/schema/entity/services/ingestionPipelines/ingestionPipeline.json#L14)

### Extracting MWAA Metadata

To extract MWAA information we will need to take a couple of points in consideration:
1. How to get the underlying database connection info, and
2. How to make sure we can reach such database.

#### Getting the DB connection

The happy path would be going to the `Airflow UI > Admin > Configurations` and finding the `sql_alchemy_conn` parameter.

However, MWAA is not providing this information. Instead, we need to create a DAG to get the connection details
once. The DAG can be deleted afterwards. We want to use a Python Operator that will retrieve the Airflow's Session data:

```python
import logging
import os
from datetime import timedelta

import yaml
from airflow import DAG

try:
    from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
except ModuleNotFoundError:
    from airflow.operators.python_operator import PythonOperator

from airflow.utils.dates import days_ago

from airflow.configuration import conf

default_args = {
    "owner": "user_name",
    "email": ["username@org.com"],
    "email_on_failure": False,
    "retries": 3,
    "retry_delay": timedelta(minutes=5),
    "execution_timeout": timedelta(minutes=60),
}

def get_data():
    from airflow.settings import Session

    logging.info("SQL ALCHEMY CONN")
    sqlalchemy_conn = conf.get("core", "sql_alchemy_conn", fallback=None)
    logging.info(sqlalchemy_conn)


with DAG(
    "airflow_database_connection",
    default_args=default_args,
    description="An example DAG which pushes Airflow data to OM",
    start_date=days_ago(1),
    is_paused_upon_creation=True,
    schedule_interval="@once",
    catchup=False,
) as dag:
    ingest_task = PythonOperator(
        task_id="db_connection",
        python_callable=get_data,
    )
```

After running the DAG, we can store the connection details and remove the dag file from S3.

#### Preparing the metadata extraction

We will use ECS here as well to get the metadata out of MWAA. The only important detail is to ensure that we are
using the right networking.

When creating the ECS cluster, add the VPC, subnets and security groups used when setting up MWAA. We need to
be in the same network environment as MWAA to reach the underlying database. In the task information, we'll configure the
same task we did for the previous metadata extraction.

Now, we are ready to prepare the DAG to extract MWAA metadata:

```python
from datetime import datetime

import yaml
from airflow import DAG

from http import client
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.providers.amazon.aws.operators.ecs import ECSOperator
from airflow.utils.dates import days_ago
import boto3


CLUSTER_NAME="openmetadata-ingestion-vpc" #Replace value for CLUSTER_NAME with your information.
CONTAINER_NAME="openmetadata-ingestion" #Replace value for CONTAINER_NAME with your information.
LAUNCH_TYPE="FARGATE"

        overrides={
            "containerOverrides":[
                {

                      },
                      {
                        "name": "pipelineType",
                        "value": "metadata"

        awslogs_group="/ecs/ingest",
        awslogs_stream_prefix=f"ecs/{CONTAINER_NAME}",
    )
```

A YAML connection example could be:

```yaml
source:
  type: airflow
  serviceName: airflow_mwaa_ecs_op
  serviceConnection:
    config:
      type: Airflow
      hostPort: http://localhost:8080

    enableVersionValidation: false
    hostPort: https://sandbox.open-metadata.org/api
    authProvider: openmetadata
    securityConfig:
      jwtToken: ...
```


## Ingestion Workflows as a Python Virtualenv Operator

### PROs

- Installation does not clash with existing libraries
- Simpler than ECS

### CONs

- We need to install an additional plugin in MWAA
- DAGs take longer to run due to needing to set up the virtualenv from scratch for each run.

We need to update the `requirements.txt` file from the MWAA environment to add the following line:

```
virtualenv
```

Then, we need to set up a custom plugin in MWAA. Create a file named virtual_python_plugin.py. Note that you may need to update the python version (eg, python3.7 -> python3.10) depending on what your MWAA environment is running.

Next, create the plugins.zip file and upload it according to [AWS docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mwaa/latest/userguide/configuring-dag-import-plugins.html). You will also need to [disable lazy plugin loading in MWAA](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mwaa/latest/userguide/samples-virtualenv.html#samples-virtualenv-airflow-config).

```

Where you can update the YAML configuration and workflow classes accordingly. accordingly. Further examples on how to
run the ingestion can be found on the documentation (e.g., [Snowflake](https://docs.open-metadata.org/connectors/database/snowflake)).

You will also need to determine the OpenMetadata ingestion extras and Airflow providers you need. Note that the Openmetadata version needs to match the server version. If we are using the server at 0.12.2, then the ingestion package needs to also be 0.12.2.  An example of the extras would look like this `openmetadata-ingestion[mysql,snowflake,s3]==0.12.2.2`.
For Airflow providers, you will want to pull the provider versions from [the matching constraints file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/constraints-2.4.3/constraints-3.7.txt). Since this example installs Airflow Providers v2.4.3 on Python 3.7, we use that constraints file.

Also note that the ingestion workflow function must be entirely self contained as it will run by itself in the virtualenv. Any imports it needs, including the configuration, must exist within the function itself.

### Extracting MWAA Metadata

As the ingestion process will be happening locally in MWAA, we can prepare a DAG with the following YAML
configuration:

```yaml
source:
  type: airflow
  serviceName: airflow_mwaa
  serviceConnection:
    config:
      type: Airflow
      hostPort: http://localhost:8080
      numberOfStatus: 10
      connection:
        type: Backend
  sourceConfig:
    config:
      type: PipelineMetadata
sink:
  type: metadata-rest
  config: {}
workflowConfig:
  loggerLevel: INFO
  openMetadataServerConfig:
    hostPort: <OpenMetadata host and port>
    authProvider: <OpenMetadata auth provider>
```

Using the connection type `Backend` will pick up the Airflow database session directly at runtime.
