In this section, we provide guides and references to use the Redash connector.

Configure and schedule Redash metadata and profiler workflows from the OpenMetadata UI:

- [Requirements](#requirements)
- [Metadata Ingestion](#metadata-ingestion)

## Requirements

{%inlineCallout icon="description" bold="OpenMetadata 0.12 or later" href="/deployment"%}
To deploy OpenMetadata, check the Deployment guides.

### Python Requirements

To run the Redash ingestion, you will need to install:

```bash
pip3 install "openmetadata-ingestion[redash]"
```

## Metadata Ingestion

All connectors are defined as JSON Schemas.
[Here](https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/blob/main/openmetadata-spec/src/main/resources/json/schema/entity/services/connections/dashboard/redashConnection.json)
you can find the structure to create a connection to Redash.

In order to create and run a Metadata Ingestion workflow, we will follow
the steps to create a YAML configuration able to connect to the source,
process the Entities if needed, and reach the OpenMetadata server.

The workflow is modeled around the following
[JSON Schema](https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/blob/main/openmetadata-spec/src/main/resources/json/schema/metadataIngestion/workflow.json)

### 1. Define the YAML Config

{% codePreview %}

{% codeInfoContainer %}

#### Source Configuration - Service Connection

{% codeInfo srNumber=1 %}

**hostPort**: URL to the Redash instance.

{% /codeInfo %}

{% codeInfo srNumber=2 %}

**username**: Specify the User to connect to Redash. It should have enough privileges to read all the metadata.

{% /codeInfo %}

{% codeInfo srNumber=3 %}

**apiKey**: API key of the redash instance to access. It has the same permissions as the user who owns it.
Can be found on a user profile page.

{% /codeInfo %}

{% codeInfo srNumber=4 %}

**Redash Version**: Redash version of your redash instance. Enter the numerical value from the [Redash Releases](https://github.com/getredash/redash/releases) page. Default: `10.0.0`.

{% /codeInfo %}

#### Source Configuration - Source Config

{% codeInfo srNumber=5 %}

The `sourceConfig` is defined [here](https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/blob/main/openmetadata-spec/src/main/resources/json/schema/metadataIngestion/dashboardServiceMetadataPipeline.json):

- **dbServiceNames**: Database Service Names for ingesting lineage if the source supports it.
- **dashboardFilterPattern**, **chartFilterPattern**, **dataModelFilterPattern**: Note that all of them support regex as include or exclude. E.g., "My dashboard, My dash.*, .*Dashboard".
- **projectFilterPattern**: Filter the dashboards, charts and data sources by projects. Note that all of them support regex as include or exclude. E.g., "My project, My proj.*, .*Project".
- **includeOwners**: Set the 'Include Owners' toggle to control whether to include owners to the ingested entity if the owner email matches with a user stored in the OM server as part of metadata ingestion. If the ingested entity already exists and has an owner, the owner will not be overwritten.
- **includeTags**: Set the 'Include Tags' toggle to control whether to include tags in metadata ingestion.
- **includeDataModels**: Set the 'Include Data Models' toggle to control whether to include tags as part of metadata ingestion.
- **markDeletedDashboards**: Set the 'Mark Deleted Dashboards' toggle to flag dashboards as soft-deleted if they are not present anymore in the source system.

{% /codeInfo %}

#### Sink Configuration

{% codeInfo srNumber=6 %}

To send the metadata to OpenMetadata, it needs to be specified as `type: metadata-rest`.

{% /codeInfo %}

{% partial file="/v1.2/connectors/workflow-config.md" /%}

{% /codeInfoContainer %}

{% codeBlock fileName="filename.yaml" %}

```yaml
source:
  type: redash
  serviceName: local_redash
  serviceConnection:
    config:
      type: Redash
```
```yaml {% srNumber=1 %}
      hostPort: http://localhost:5000
```
```yaml {% srNumber=2 %}
      username: random
```
```yaml {% srNumber=3 %}
      apiKey: api_key
```
```yaml {% srNumber=4 %}
      redashVersion: 10.0.0
```
```yaml {% srNumber=5 %}
  sourceConfig:
    config:
      type: DashboardMetadata
      # dbServiceNames:
      #   - service1
      #   - service2
      # dashboardFilterPattern:
      #   includes:
      #     - dashboard1
      #     - dashboard2
      #   excludes:
      #     - dashboard3
      #     - dashboard4
      # chartFilterPattern:
      #   includes:
      #     - chart1
      #     - chart2
      #   excludes:
      #     - chart3
      #     - chart4
      # projectFilterPattern:
      #   includes:
      #     - project1
      #     - project2
      #   excludes:
      #     - project3
      #     - project4
```
```yaml {% srNumber=6 %}
sink:
  type: metadata-rest
  config: {}
```

{% partial file="/v1.2/connectors/workflow-config-yaml.md" /%}

{% /codeBlock %}

{% /codePreview %}

### 2. Run with the CLI

First, we will need to save the YAML file. Afterward, and with all requirements installed, we can run:

```bash
metadata ingest -c <path-to-yaml>
```

Note that from connector to connector, this recipe will always be the same. By updating the YAML configuration,
you will be able to extract metadata from different sources.
