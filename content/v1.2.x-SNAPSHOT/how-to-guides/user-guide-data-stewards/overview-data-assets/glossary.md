## Glossary Terms and Tags

If **Tags** are associated with a **Glossary Term**, then applying that glossary term to a data asset, will also automatically apply the associated tags to that data asset. For example, the glossary term ‘Account’ has a PII.Sensitive tag associated with it. When you add a glossary term to a data asset, the associated tags also get added.
