# How to Invite Users to OpenMetadata

Data is a team game and OpenMetadata is a platform to discover, collaborate and get your data right. Collaboration works best when all the team members have access to a standard tool. Admins can send invitations and invite users to onboard to OpenMetadata.

- Navigate to **Settings >> Users** and click on **Add Users**.
