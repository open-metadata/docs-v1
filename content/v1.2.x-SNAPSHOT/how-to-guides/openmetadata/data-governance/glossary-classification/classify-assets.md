# How to Classify Data Assets

## How to Add Classification Tags

- From the Explore page, select a data asset and click on the edit icon or + Add for Tags.
- Search for the relevant tags. You can either type and search, or scroll to select from the options provided.
- Click on the checkmark to save the changes.

The tagged data assets can be discovered right from the Classification page. 
- Navigate to **Govern >> Classification**.
- The list of tags is displayed along with the details of Usage in various data assets.
- Click on the Usage number to view the tagged assets.

You can view all the tags in the right panel.

Data assets can also be classified using Tiers. Learn more about [Tiers](/how-to-guides/openmetadata/data-governance/glossary-classification/tiers).

Among the Classification Tags, OpenMetadata has some System Classification. Learn more about the [System Tags](/how-to-guides/openmetadata/data-governance/glossary-classification/classification).

## Task: Request to Update Tags

Apart from adding the tags directly, users can also request to update tags. This is typically done when the user wants another opinion on the tag being added, or if the user does not have access to add tags directly.

- Click on the **?** icon next to tags

{% image

/%}

- A Task will be created with some pre-populated details. Fill in the other important information:
  - **Title** - This is auto-populated
  - **Assignees** - Multiple users can be added
  - **Update Tags** - It displays 3 tabs. 
    - You can view the **Current** tags. 
    - You can add the **New** tags.
    - It will display the **Difference** as well.
  - Click on **Submit** to create the task.

Once a task has been created, it is displayed in the **Activity Feeds & Tasks** tab for that Data Asset. The assignees, can either `Accept the Suggestion` or `Edit and Accept the Suggestion`. Assignees can also add a **Comment**. They can also add other users as **Assignees**.

## Conversations around Classification

Apart from requesting for tags, users can also create a **Conversation** around the tags assigned to a data asset.
- Click on the **Conversation** icon next to the tag.

/%}

- Start a conversation right within the data asset page. Add **@mention** to tag a user or team. Add a **#mention** to tag a data asset.

{% image

- Further in the conversation, users can **Reply** to discuss further as well as add **Reactions**, **Edit**, or **Delete**.

## Auto-Classification in OpenMetadata

OpenMetadata identifies PII data and auto tags or suggests the tags. The data profiler automatically tags the PII-Sensitive data. The addition of tags about PII data helps consumers and governance teams identify data that needs to be treated carefully.

In the example below, the columns ‘user_name’ and ‘social security number’ are auto-tagged as PII-sensitive. This works using NLP as part of the profiler during ingestion.

alt="User_name and Social Security Number are Auto-Classified as PII Sensitive"
caption="User_name and Social Security Number are Auto-Classified as PII Sensitive"
/%}

In the below example, the column ‘dwh_x10’ is also auto-tagged as PII Sensitive, even though the column name does not provide much information. 

{% image
src="/images/v1.1/how-to-guides/governance/auto2.png"
alt="Column Name does not provide much information"
caption="Column Name does not provide much information"
/%}

When we look at the content of the column ‘dwh_x10’ in the Sample Data tab, it becomes clear that the auto-classification is based on the data in the column.

## Tag Mapping

Tag mapping is supported in the backend and not in the OpenMetadata UI. When two related tags are associated with each other, applying one tag, automatically applies the other tag. For example, when the tag `Personal Data.Personal` is applied, it automatically applies another tag `Data Classification.Confidential`. That way, applying the tag `Personal` automatically applies the tag `Confidential`.
