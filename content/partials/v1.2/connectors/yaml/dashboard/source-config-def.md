{% codeInfo srNumber=100 %}

The `sourceConfig` is defined [here](https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/blob/main/openmetadata-spec/src/main/resources/json/schema/metadataIngestion/dashboardServiceMetadataPipeline.json):

- **dbServiceNames**: Database Service Names for ingesting lineage if the source supports it.
- **dashboardFilterPattern**, **chartFilterPattern**, **dataModelFilterPattern**: Note that all of them support regex as include or exclude. E.g., "My dashboard, My dash.*, .*Dashboard".
- **projectFilterPattern**: Filter the dashboards, charts and data sources by projects. Note that all of them support regex as include or exclude. E.g., "My project, My proj.*, .*Project".
- **includeOwners**: Set the 'Include Owners' toggle to control whether to include owners to the ingested entity if the owner email matches with a user stored in the OM server as part of metadata ingestion. If the ingested entity already exists and has an owner, the owner will not be overwritten.
- **includeTags**: Set the 'Include Tags' toggle to control whether to include tags in metadata ingestion.
- **includeDataModels**: Set the 'Include Data Models' toggle to control whether to include tags as part of metadata ingestion.
- **markDeletedDashboards**: Set the 'Mark Deleted Dashboards' toggle to flag dashboards as soft-deleted if they are not present anymore in the source system.
