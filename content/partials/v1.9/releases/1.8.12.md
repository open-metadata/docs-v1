## Improvements

- Removed beta label from useDynamicAssertion in AutomatorTestCaseField component
- Added paginated assets API endpoints for Domain, Data Product, Glossary Term, Tag, Team, and User entities for improved scalability
- Added support for MF4 (Measurement Data Format version 4) file reader for automotive and industrial measurement data
- Added support for BigQuery clone queries (CREATE TABLE ... CLONE) in lineage tracking
- Improved handling of nested column structures (subfields) in Datalake sources

## Fixes

- Fixed German language UI translations for login page
- Fixed UC Ingestion failing due to non-selected tables
- Fixed MF4 file reader import errors with proper lazy loading of dependencies
- Fixed domain assets count mismatch between API and UI responses
- Fixed Bulk Import to preserve existing metadata when fields are not included in the CSV
- Pinned pydantic dependency to version <2.12.0 for compatibility

## Deprecation Notice

- The inline assets field in Domain and Data Product entities has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
- New paginated API endpoints have been introduced for better performance with large asset collections:
    - GET /v1/domains/{id}/assets - Paginated access to domain assets by ID
    - GET /v1/domains/name/{name}/assets - Paginated access to domain assets by name
    - GET /v1/dataProducts/{id}/assets - Paginated access to data product assets by ID
    - GET /v1/dataProducts/name/{name}/assets - Paginated access to data product assets by name

Similar endpoints (both by ID and name) have been added for Glossary Terms, Tags, Teams, and Users.
Action Required

- Update your integrations to use the new paginated endpoints instead of relying on the inline assets field. Python SDK users should migrate to ometa.get_domain_assets(domain_id) and ometa.get_data_product_assets(data_product_id).
