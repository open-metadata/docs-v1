- NiFi Connector: The NiFi connector has been enhanced to support Execution Time.
- Domain Migrations: Added missing domain migrations for entity version history to ensure schema consistency.

## What's Fixed üêû

- UI Performance: Resolved a significant UI lag that occurred when viewing Kafka topics with large or deeply nested schemas.

### Lineage UI:

- Fixed an issue where lineage layers were not visible upfront upon loading the page.
- Corrected panel alignment issues in the full-screen lineage edit mode.

### Connectors:

- Snowflake: Fixed a bug where tags were not being inherited correctly from schemas.
- SAP HANA: Corrected the physical schema mapping and column lookup for calculation views.
- Soft Deletion: Fixed an issue where columns for soft-deleted tables were not being displayed correctly.
- Tags: Resolved a Null Pointer Exception that occurred when using the "Match All Tags" filter on a resource that had no tags.
- Domains: Fixed an incorrect condition in the getDomains() method to ensure domains are retrieved accurately.
- Personas: Addressed a pagination issue on the Persona listing page.

## Breaking Changes üí•

- API Configuration Removal: The ability to configure authorizer or authentication for individual APIs has been removed. This change simplifies security management by centralizing these settings at the application level, removing redundant and potentially conflicting configurations. All authentication and authorization should now be managed through the primary security configuration.
