# How to Change the Team Type

Refer to the [**Team Structure in OpenMetadata**](/how-to-guides/quick-start-guide-for-admins/teams-and-users/team-structure-openmetadata) to get a clear understanding of the various **Team Types**.

Let's say you have a team `Cloud_Infra` of the type **`Department`** and you want to change it to the type **`BusinessUnit`**. You can easily change that through the UI.

**1.** Navigate to **Settings >> Teams**. Click on the `Cloud_Infra` team name to view the details.

**2.** On the `Cloud_Infra` team details page, you will see the `Type - Department` with an edit icon.

**3.** Click on the edit button. You will get a set of options, from which you can select `BusinessUnit`.Click on âœ… to save it.
