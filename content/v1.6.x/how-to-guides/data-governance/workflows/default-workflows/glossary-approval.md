# Governance Workflows - Glossary Approval Workflow (Default)

The **Glossary Approval Workflow** is designed to define the process of updating the status of Glossary Terms within Collate.
It is triggered when a Glossary Term is created or updated and it ensures it undergoes a review process until it reaches the desired status.

## Workflow Elements
