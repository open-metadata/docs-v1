In this section, we provide guides and references to use the Redshift connector.

Configure and schedule Redshift metadata and profiler workflows from the OpenMetadata UI:

- [Data Profiler](/connectors/ingestion/workflows/profiler)
- [Data Quality](/connectors/ingestion/workflows/data-quality)
- [Lineage](/connectors/ingestion/lineage)
- [dbt Integration](/connectors/ingestion/workflows/dbt)

## Requirements

{%inlineCallout icon="description" bold="OpenMetadata 0.12 or later" href="/deployment"%}
To deploy OpenMetadata, check the Deployment guides.
{%/inlineCallout%}

### Metadata
Redshift user must grant `SELECT` privilege on table [SVV_TABLE_INFO](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_SVV_TABLE_INFO.html) to fetch the metadata of tables and views. For more information visit [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/c_visibility-of-data.html).

```sql
-- Create a new user
-- More details https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_CREATE_USER.html
CREATE USER test_user with PASSWORD 'password';

-- Grant SELECT on table
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE svv_table_info to test_user;
```

### Profiler & Data Quality
Executing the profiler workflow or data quality tests, will require the user to have `SELECT` permission on the tables/schemas where the profiler/tests will be executed. More information on the profiler workflow setup can be found [here](https://docs.open-metadata.org/connectors/ingestion/workflows/profiler) and data quality tests [here](https://docs.open-metadata.org/connectors/ingestion/workflows/data-quality).

### Usage & Lineage
For the usage and lineage workflow, the user will need `SELECT` privilege on `STL_QUERY` table. You can find more information on the usage workflow [here](https://docs.open-metadata.org/connectors/ingestion/workflows/usage) and the lineage workflow [here](https://docs.open-metadata.org/connectors/ingestion/workflows/lineage).

## Metadata Ingestion

{% partial 
  file="/v1.1/connectors/metadata-ingestion-ui.md" 
  variables={
    connector: "Redshift", 
    selectServicePath: "/images/v1.1/connectors/redshift/select-service.png",
    addNewServicePath: "/images/v1.1/connectors/redshift/add-new-service.png",
    serviceConnectionPath: "/images/v1.1/connectors/redshift/service-connection.png",
} 
/%}

#### Connection Details

- **Username**: Specify the User to connect to Redshift. It should have enough privileges to read all the metadata.
- **Password**: Password to connect to Redshift.
- **Database (Optional)**: The database of the data source is an optional parameter, if you would like to restrict the metadata reading to a single database. If left blank, OpenMetadata ingestion attempts to scan all the databases.

{% note %}
During the metadata ingestion for redshift, the tables in which the distribution style i.e, `DISTSTYLE` is not `AUTO` will be marked as partitioned tables
{% /note %}

**SSL Configuration**

In order to integrate SSL in the Metadata Ingestion Config, the user will have to add the SSL config under connectionArguments which is placed in the source.

**SSL Modes**

There are a couple of types of SSL modes that Redshift supports which can be added to ConnectionArguments, they are as follows:
- **disable**: SSL is disabled and the connection is not encrypted.

- **allow**: SSL is used if the server requires it.

- **prefer**: SSL is used if the server supports it. Amazon Redshift supports SSL, so SSL is used when you set sslmode to prefer.

- **require**: SSL is required.

- **verify-ca**: SSL must be used and the server certificate must be verified.

- **verify-full**: SSL must be used. The server certificate must be verified and the server hostname must match the hostname attribute on the certificate.

For more information, you can visit [Redshift SSL documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/connecting-ssl-support.html)
