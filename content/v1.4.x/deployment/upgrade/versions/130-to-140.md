# Upgrade from 1.3.x to 1.4.x

Upgrading from 1.3.x to 1.4.x can be done directly on your instances. This page will list few general details you should take into consideration when running the upgrade.


## Deprecation Notice

## Breaking Changes for 1.4.x Stable Release

### Dashboard & Pipeline Source Config Changes

We have restructured how we input the dbServiceNames field, used for creating lineage between pipeline(spline) and tables & dashboard data models and tables. This change was done in order to highlight the field on UI and improve user experience.

Please make note of changes in your yaml.

Before:
```
sourceConfig:
    config:
        type: DashboardMetadata # or PipelineMetadata
        .....
        dbServiceNames:
        - redshift_prod
        .....
```

After 1.4.0 Upgrade:
```
sourceConfig:
    config:
        type: DashboardMetadata # or PipelineMetadata
        .....
        lineageInformation:
            dbServiceNames:
            - redshift_prod
        .....
```

### Custom severity classifier config

We have updated `openmetadata.yaml` config file and removed the below setting option. If you were previously using it reach out to our team on #support channel in slack.

```
dataQualityConfiguration:
   severityIncidentClassifier: ${DATA_QUALITY_SEVERITY_INCIDENT_CLASSIFIER:-"org.openmetadata.service.util.incidentSeverityClassifier.LogisticRegressionIncidentSeverityClassifier"}
```

### Custom Connectors: Updates to the Initialization Method for Source Class

We have introduced a new parameter, `pipeline_name` to the initialization method of source python classes. This change will also apply to the initialization of custom connectors.

Please ensure to update your initialization methods accordingly, as demonstrated below.

Before:
```
@classmethod
def create(
    cls,
    config_dict: dict,
    metadata_config: OpenMetadataConnection
):
    config: WorkflowSource = WorkflowSource.model_validate(config_dict)
    .....
    .....
    return cls(config, metadata_config)
```

After 1.4.0 Upgrade:
```
@classmethod
def create(
    cls,
    config_dict: dict,
    metadata_config: OpenMetadataConnection,
    pipeline_name: Optional[str] = None
):
    config: WorkflowSource = WorkflowSource.model_validate(config_dict)
    .....
    .....
    return cls(config, metadata_config)
```
