In this section, we provide guides and references to use the BigTable connector.

Configure and schedule BigTable metadata and profiler workflows from the OpenMetadata UI:

- [Requirements](#requirements)
- [Metadata Ingestion](#metadata-ingestion)

## Requirements

### Python Requirements

{% partial file="/v1.4/connectors/python-requirements.md" /%}

To run the BigTable ingestion, you will need to install:

```bash
pip3 install "openmetadata-ingestion[bigtable]"
```

### GCP Permissions

To execute metadata extraction and usage workflow successfully the user or the service account should have enough access to fetch required data. Following table describes the minimum required permissions

{% multiTablesWrapper %}

| #    | GCP Permission                | Required For            |
| :--- | :---------------------------- | :---------------------- |
| 1    | bigtable.instances.get        | Metadata Ingestion      |
| 2    | bigtable.instances.list       | Metadata Ingestion      |
| 3    | bigtable.tables.get           | Metadata Ingestion      |
| 4    | bigtable.tables.list          | Metadata Ingestion      |
| 5    | bigtable.tables.readRows      | Metadata Ingestion      |

## Metadata Ingestion

### 1. Define the YAML Config

This is a sample config for BigTable:

{% codePreview %}

{% codeInfoContainer %}

#### Source Configuration - Service Connection

{% codeInfo srNumber=1 %}

**credentials**: 
You can authenticate with your bigtable instance using either `GCP Credentials Path` where you can specify the file path of the service account key or you can pass the values directly by choosing the `GCP Credentials Values` from the service account key file.

You can checkout [this](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-create-delete#iam-service-account-keys-create-console) documentation on how to create the service account keys and download it.

**gcpConfig:**

**1.** Passing the raw credential values provided by BigTable. This requires us to provide the following information, all provided by BigTable:

  - **type**: Credentials Type is the type of the account, for a service account the value of this field is `service_account`. To fetch this key, look for the value associated with the `type` key in the service account key file.
  - **projectId**: A project ID is a unique string used to differentiate your project from all others in Google Cloud. To fetch this key, look for the value associated with the `project_id` key in the service account key file. You can also pass multiple project id to ingest metadata from different BigTable projects into one service.
  - **privateKeyId**: This is a unique identifier for the private key associated with the service account. To fetch this key, look for the value associated with the `private_key_id` key in the service account file.
  - **privateKey**: This is the private key associated with the service account that is used to authenticate and authorize access to BigTable. To fetch this key, look for the value associated with the `private_key` key in the service account file.
  - **clientEmail**: This is the email address associated with the service account. To fetch this key, look for the value associated with the `client_email` key in the service account key file.
  - **clientId**: This is a unique identifier for the service account. To fetch this key, look for the value associated with the `client_id` key in the service account key  file.
  - **authUri**: This is the URI for the authorization server. To fetch this key, look for the value associated with the `auth_uri` key in the service account key file. The default value to Auth URI is https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth.
  - **tokenUri**: The Google Cloud Token URI is a specific endpoint used to obtain an OAuth 2.0 access token from the Google Cloud IAM service. This token allows you to authenticate and access various Google Cloud resources and APIs that require authorization. To fetch this key, look for the value associated with the `token_uri` key in the service account credentials file. Default Value to Token URI is https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token.
  - **authProviderX509CertUrl**: This is the URL of the certificate that verifies the authenticity of the authorization server. To fetch this key, look for the value associated with the `auth_provider_x509_cert_url` key in the service account key file. The Default value for Auth Provider X509Cert URL is https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs
  - **clientX509CertUrl**: This is the URL of the certificate that verifies the authenticity of the service account. To fetch this key, look for the value associated with the `client_x509_cert_url` key in the service account key  file.

**2.**  Passing a local file path that contains the credentials:
  - **gcpCredentialsPath**

#### Advanced Configuration

{% codeInfo srNumber=2 %}

**Connection Options (Optional)**: Enter the details for any additional connection options that can be sent to database during the connection. These details must be added as Key-Value pairs.

{% /codeInfo %}

{% codeInfo srNumber=3 %}

**Connection Arguments (Optional)**: Enter the details for any additional connection arguments such as security or protocol configs that can be sent to database during the connection. These details must be added as Key-Value pairs.

- In case you are using Single-Sign-On (SSO) for authentication, add the `authenticator` details in the Connection Arguments as a Key-Value pair as follows: `"authenticator" : "sso_login_url"`
