# Connectors

OpenMetadata can extract metadata from the following list of connectors below.

## Ingestion Deployment

To run the Ingestion via the UI you'll need to use the OpenMetadata Ingestion Container, which comes shipped with
custom Airflow plugins to handle the workflow deployment. If you want to install it manually in an already existing
Airflow host, you can follow [this](/deployment/ingestion/openmetadata) guide.

If you don't want to use the OpenMetadata Ingestion container to configure the workflows via the UI, then you can check
the following docs to run the Ingestion Framework in any orchestrator externally.
