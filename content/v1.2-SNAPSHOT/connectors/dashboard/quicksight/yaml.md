AWS QuickSight Permissions
To execute metadata extraction and usage workflow successfully the IAM User should have enough access to fetch required data. Following table describes the minimum required permissions

| # | AWS QuickSight Permission |
| :---------- | :---------- |
| 1 | DescribeDashboard |
| 2 | ListAnalyses |
| 3 | ListDataSources |
| 4 | ListDashboards |
| 5 | DescribeAnalysis |
| 6 | DescribeDataSet |
| 7 | ListDataSets |
| 8 | DescribeDataSource |

Here is how to add Permissions to an IAM user.

- Navigate to the IAM console in the AWS Management Console.

- Choose the IAM user or group to which you want to attach the policy, and click on the "Permissions" tab.

- Click on the "Add permissions" button and select "Attach existing policies directly".

- Search for the policy by name or by filtering the available policies, and select the one you want to attach.

- Review the policy and click on "Add permissions" to complete the process.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "quicksight:DescribeDashboard",
                "quicksight:ListAnalyses",
                "quicksight:ListDataSources",
                "quicksight:ListDashboards",
                "quicksight:DescribeAnalysis",
                "quicksight:DescribeDataSet",
                "quicksight:ListDataSets",
                "quicksight:DescribeDataSource"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Python Requirements

To run the QuickSight ingestion, you will need to install:

```bash
pip3 install "openmetadata-ingestion[quicksight]"
```

## Metadata Ingestion

All connectors are defined as JSON Schemas.
[Here](https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/blob/main/openmetadata-spec/src/main/resources/json/schema/entity/services/connections/dashboard/quickSightConnection.json)
you can find the structure to create a connection to QuickSight.

In order to create and run a Metadata Ingestion workflow, we will follow
the steps to create a YAML configuration able to connect to the source,
process the Entities if needed, and reach the OpenMetadata server.

The workflow is QuickSightled around the following
[JSON Schema](https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/blob/main/openmetadata-spec/src/main/resources/json/schema/metadataIngestion/workflow.json)

### 1. Define the YAML Config

This is a sample config for QuickSight:

{% codePreview %}

{% codeInfoContainer %}

#### Source Configuration - Service Connection

{% codeInfo srNumber=1 %}

**awsConfig**
  - **AWS Access Key ID**: Enter your secure access key ID for your Glue connection. The specified key ID should be authorized to read all databases you want to include in the metadata ingestion workflow.
  - **AWS Secret Access Key**: Enter the Secret Access Key (the passcode key pair to the key ID from above).
  - **AWS Region**: Enter the location of the amazon cluster that your data and account are associated with.
  - **AWS Session Token (optional)**: The AWS session token is an optional parameter. If you want, enter the details of your temporary session token.
  - **Endpoint URL (optional)**: Your Glue connector will automatically determine the AWS QuickSight endpoint URL based on the region. You may override this behavior by entering a value to the endpoint URL.

{% /codeInfo %}

{% codeInfo srNumber=2 %}

**awsAccountId**: AWS Account ID

{% /codeInfo %}

{% codeInfo srNumber=3 %}

**identityType**: The authentication method that the user uses to sign in.

{% /codeInfo %}

{% codeInfo srNumber=4 %}

**namespace**: The Amazon QuickSight namespace that contains the dashboard IDs in this request ( To be provided when identityType is `ANONYMOUS` )

{% /codeInfo %}

#### Source Configuration - Source Config

{% codeInfo srNumber=5 %}

The `sourceConfig` is defined [here](https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/blob/main/openmetadata-spec/src/main/resources/json/schema/metadataIngestion/dashboardServiceMetadataPipeline.json):

- **dbServiceNames**: Database Service Names for ingesting lineage if the source supports it.
- **dashboardFilterPattern**, **chartFilterPattern**, **dataModelFilterPattern**: Note that all of them support regex as include or exclude. E.g., "My dashboard, My dash.*, .*Dashboard".
- **projectFilterPattern**: Filter the dashboards, charts and data sources by projects. Note that all of them support regex as include or exclude. E.g., "My project, My proj.*, .*Project".
- **includeOwners**: Set the 'Include Owners' toggle to control whether to include owners to the ingested entity if the owner email matches with a user stored in the OM server as part of metadata ingestion. If the ingested entity already exists and has an owner, the owner will not be overwritten.
- **includeTags**: Set the 'Include Tags' toggle to control whether to include tags in metadata ingestion.
- **includeDataModels**: Set the 'Include Data Models' toggle to control whether to include tags as part of metadata ingestion.
- **markDeletedDashboards**: Set the 'Mark Deleted Dashboards' toggle to flag dashboards as soft-deleted if they are not present anymore in the source system.

{% /codeInfo %}

#### Sink Configuration

{% codeInfo srNumber=6 %}

To send the metadata to OpenMetadata, it needs to be specified as `type: metadata-rest`.

{% /codeInfo %}

{% partial file="/v1.2/connectors/workflow-config.md" /%}

{% /codeInfoContainer %}

{% codeBlock fileName="filename.yaml" %}

```yaml
source:
  type: quicksight
  serviceName: local_quicksight
  serviceConnection:
    config:
      type: QuickSight
```
```yaml {% srNumber=1 %}
      awsConfig:
        awsAccessKeyId: KEY
        awsSecretAccessKey: SECRET
        awsRegion: us-east-2
        awsSessionToken: Token
```
```yaml {% srNumber=2 %}
      awsAccountId: <aws-account-id>
```
```yaml {% srNumber=3 %}
      identityType: IAM #QUICKSIGHT, ANONYMOUS
```
```yaml {% srNumber=4 %}
      namespace: #to be provided if identityType is Anonymous
```
```yaml {% srNumber=5 %}
  sourceConfig:
    config:
      type: DashboardMetadata
      markDeletedDashboards: True
      # dbServiceNames:
      #   - service1
      #   - service2
      # dashboardFilterPattern:
      #   includes:
      #     - dashboard1
      #     - dashboard2
      #   excludes:
      #     - dashboard3
      #     - dashboard4
      # chartFilterPattern:
      #   includes:
      #     - chart1
      #     - chart2
      #   excludes:
      #     - chart3
      #     - chart4
      # projectFilterPattern:
      #   includes:
      #     - project1
      #     - project2
      #   excludes:
      #     - project3
      #     - project4

```yaml {% srNumber=6 %}
sink:
  type: metadata-rest
  config: {}
```

{% partial file="/v1.2/connectors/workflow-config-yaml.md" /%}

{% /codeBlock %}

{% /codePreview %}

### 2. Run with the CLI

First, we will need to save the YAML file. Afterward, and with all requirements installed, we can run:

```bash
metadata ingest -c <path-to-yaml>
```

Note that from connector to connector, this recipe will always be the same. By updating the YAML configuration,
you will be able to extract metadata from different sources.
