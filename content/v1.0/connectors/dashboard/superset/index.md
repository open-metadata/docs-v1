In this section, we provide guides and references to use the Superset connector.

Configure and schedule Superset metadata and profiler workflows from the OpenMetadata UI:

- [Requirements](#requirements)
- [Metadata Ingestion](#metadata-ingestion)

If you don't want to use the OpenMetadata Ingestion container to configure the workflows via the UI, then you can check
the following docs to connect using Airflow SDK or with the CLI.

## Requirements

{%inlineCallout icon="description" bold="OpenMetadata 0.12 or later" href="/deployment"%}
To deploy OpenMetadata, check the Deployment guides.
{%/inlineCallout%}

To run the Ingestion via the UI you'll need to use the OpenMetadata Ingestion Container, which comes shipped with
custom Airflow plugins to handle the workflow deployment.

The ingestion also works with Superset 2.0.0 ðŸŽ‰

**Note:**

**API Connection**: To extract metadata from Superset via API, user must have at least `can read on Chart` & `can read on Dashboard` permissions.

**Database Connection**: To extract metadata from Superset via MySQL or Postgres database, database user must have at least `SELECT` priviledge on `dashboards` & `slices` tables within superset schema.

## Metadata Ingestion

{% stepsContainer %}

{% step srNumber=1 %}

{% stepDescription title="1. Visit the Services Page" %}

The first step is ingesting the metadata from your sources. Under
Settings, you will find a Services link an external source system to
OpenMetadata. Once a service is created, it can be used to configure
metadata, usage, and profiler workflows.

To visit the Services page, select Services from the Settings menu.

{% /stepVisualInfo %}

{% /step %}

{% step srNumber=4 %}

{% stepDescription title="4. Name and Describe your Service" %}

Provide a name and description for your service as illustrated below.

#### Service Name

OpenMetadata uniquely identifies services by their Service Name. Provide
a name that distinguishes your deployment from other services, including
the other {connector} services that you might be ingesting metadata
from.

{% /step %}

{% step srNumber=5 %}

{% stepDescription title="5. Configure the Service Connection" %}

In this step, we will configure the connection settings required for
this connector. Please follow the instructions below to ensure that
you've configured the connector to read from your superset service as
desired.

#### Connection Options

- **Host and Port**: The `Host and Post` parameter is common for all three modes of authentication which specifies the host and port of the Superset instance. This should be specified as a string in the format `http://hostname:port` or `https://hostname:port`. For example, you might set the hostPort parameter to `https://org.superset.com:8088`.

- **Superset Connection**: Add the connection details to fetch metadata from Superset either through APIs or Database.

##### For Superset API Connection

Superset API connection is the default mode of authentication where we fetch the metadata using [Superset APIs](https://superset.apache.org/docs/api/). 

**Note**:
Superset only supports basic or ldap authentication through APIs so if you have SSO enabled on your Superset instance then this mode of authentication will not work for you and you can opt for MySQL or Postgres Connection to fetch metadata directly from the database in the backend of Superset.

- **Username**: Username to connect to Superset, for ex. `user@organization.com`. This user should have access to relevant dashboards and charts in Superset to fetch the metadata.
- **Password**: Password of the user account to connect with Superset.
- **Provider**: Choose between `db`(default) or `ldap` mode of Authentication provider for the Superset service. This parameter is used internally to connect to Superset's REST API.

#### For MySQL Connection

You can use Mysql Connection when you have SSO enabled and your Superset is backed by Mysql database.

- **Username**: Specify the User to connect to MySQL. It should have enough privileges to read all the metadata. Make sure the user has select privileges on `dashboards`, `tables` & `slices` tables of superset schema.
- **Password**: Password to connect to MySQL.
- **Host and Port**: Enter the fully qualified hostname and port number for your MySQL deployment in the Host and Port field.
- **databaseSchema**: Enter the database schema which is associated with the Superset instance..
- **Connection Options (Optional)**: Enter the details for any additional connection options that can be sent to Athena during the connection. These details must be added as Key-Value pairs.
- **Connection Arguments (Optional)**: Enter the details for any additional connection arguments such as security or protocol configs that can be sent to Athena during the connection. These details must be added as Key-Value pairs.
  - In case you are using Single-Sign-On (SSO) for authentication, add the `authenticator` details in the Connection Arguments as a Key-Value pair as follows: `"authenticator" : "sso_login_url"`


#### For Postgres Connection

You can use Postgres Connection when you have SSO enabled and your Superset is backed by Postgres database.

- **Username**: Specify the User to connect to Postgres. Make sure the user has select privileges on `dashboards`, `tables` & `slices` tables of superset schema.
- **Password**: Password to connect to Postgres.
- **Host and Port**: Enter the fully qualified hostname and port number for your Postgres deployment in the Host and Port field.
- **Database**: Initial Postgres database to connect to. Specify the name of database associated with Superset instance.
- **Connection Options (Optional)**: Enter the details for any additional connection options that can be sent to Postgres during the connection. These details must be added as Key-Value pairs.
- **Connection Arguments (Optional)**: Enter the details for any additional connection arguments such as security or protocol configs that can be sent to Postgres during the connection. These details must be added as Key-Value pairs. 
  - In case you are using Single-Sign-On (SSO) for authentication, add the `authenticator` details in the Connection Arguments as a Key-Value pair as follows: `"authenticator" : "sso_login_url"`

## Troubleshooting

 ### Workflow Deployment Error

If there were any errors during the workflow deployment process, the
Ingestion Pipeline Entity will still be created, but no workflow will be
present in the Ingestion container.

- You can then edit the Ingestion Pipeline and Deploy it again.

- From the Connection tab, you can also Edit the Service if needed.
