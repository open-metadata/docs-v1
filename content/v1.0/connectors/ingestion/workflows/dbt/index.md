## Requirements

### AWS S3

If we have the artifacts on the bucket `MyBucket`, the user running the ingestion should have, at least, the permissions
from the following policy:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:ListBucket"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::MyBucket",
                "arn:aws:s3:::MyBucket/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that it's not enough to point the resource to `arn:aws:s3:::MyBucket`. We need its contents as well!
