Configure and schedule QuickSight metadata and profiler workflows from the OpenMetadata UI:

- [Requirements](#requirements)
- [Metadata Ingestion](#metadata-ingestion)

If you don't want to use the OpenMetadata Ingestion container to configure the workflows via the UI, then you can check
the following docs to connect using Airflow SDK or with the CLI.

AWS QuickSight Permissions
To execute metadata extraction and usage workflow successfully the IAM User should have enough access to fetch required data. Following table describes the minimum required permissions

| # | AWS QuickSight Permission |
| :---------- | :---------- |
| 1 | DescribeDashboard |
| 2 | ListAnalyses |
| 3 | ListDataSources |
| 4 | ListDashboards |
| 5 | DescribeAnalysis |
| 6 | DescribeDataSet |
| 7 | ListDataSets |
| 8 | DescribeDataSource |

Here is how to add Permissions to an IAM user.

- Navigate to the IAM console in the AWS Management Console.

- Choose the IAM user or group to which you want to attach the policy, and click on the "Permissions" tab.

- Click on the "Add permissions" button and select "Attach existing policies directly".

- Search for the policy by name or by filtering the available policies, and select the one you want to attach.

- Review the policy and click on "Add permissions" to complete the process.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "quicksight:DescribeDashboard",
                "quicksight:ListAnalyses",
                "quicksight:ListDataSources",
                "quicksight:ListDashboards",
                "quicksight:DescribeAnalysis",
                "quicksight:DescribeDataSet",
                "quicksight:ListDataSets",
                "quicksight:DescribeDataSource"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

To run the Ingestion via the UI you'll need to use the OpenMetadata Ingestion Container, which comes shipped with
custom Airflow plugins to handle the workflow deployment.

## Metadata Ingestion

{% stepsContainer %}

{% step srNumber=1 %}

{% stepDescription title="1. Visit the Services Page" %}

The first step is ingesting the metadata from your sources. Under
Settings, you will find a Services link an external source system to
OpenMetadata. Once a service is created, it can be used to configure
metadata, usage, and profiler workflows.

To visit the Services page, select Services from the Settings menu.

{% /stepVisualInfo %}

{% /step %}

{% step srNumber=4 %}

{% stepDescription title="4. Name and Describe your Service" %}

Provide a name and description for your service as illustrated below.

#### Service Name

OpenMetadata uniquely identifies services by their Service Name. Provide
a name that distinguishes your deployment from other services, including
the other {connector} services that you might be ingesting metadata
from.

{% step srNumber=5 %}

{% stepDescription title="5. Configure the Service Connection" %}

In this step, we will configure the connection settings required for
this connector. Please follow the instructions below to ensure that
you've configured the connector to read from your dashboard service as
desired.

#### Connection Options

#### Connection Options

- **awsConfig**
  - **AWS Access Key ID**: Enter your secure access key ID for your Glue connection. The specified key ID should be authorized to read all databases you want to include in the metadata ingestion workflow.
  - **AWS Secret Access Key**: Enter the Secret Access Key (the passcode key pair to the key ID from above).
  - **AWS Region**: Enter the location of the amazon cluster that your data and account are associated with.
  - **AWS Session Token (optional)**: The AWS session token is an optional parameter. If you want, enter the details of your temporary session token.
  - **Endpoint URL (optional)**: Your Glue connector will automatically determine the AWS QuickSight endpoint URL based on the region. You may override this behavior by entering a value to the endpoint URL.

- **identityType**: The authentication method that the user uses to sign in.
- **awsAccountId**: QuickSight account ID is required to manage QuickSight users, data sources, and reports.
- **namespace**: The Amazon QuickSight namespace that contains the dashboard IDs in this request ( To be provided when identityType is `ANONYMOUS` )

- **Dashboard Filter Pattern (Optional)**: Use it to control whether to include dashboard as part of metadata ingestion.
    - **Include**: Explicitly include dashboards by adding a list of comma-separated regular expressions to the 'Include' field. OpenMetadata will include all dashboards with names matching one or more of the supplied regular expressions. All other dashboards will be excluded.
    - **Exclude**: Explicitly exclude dashboards by adding a list of comma-separated regular expressions to the 'Exclude' field. OpenMetadata will exclude all dashboards with names matching one or more of the supplied regular expressions. All other dashboards will be included.
- **Chart Pattern (Optional)**: Use it to control whether to include charts as part of metadata ingestion.
    - **Include**: Explicitly include charts by adding a list of comma-separated regular expressions to the 'Include' field. OpenMetadata will include all charts with names matching one or more of the supplied regular expressions. All other charts will be excluded.

- **Enable Debug Log (toggle)**: Set the 'Enable Debug Log' toggle to set the default log level to debug, these logs can be viewed later in Airflow.
- **Include Owners (toggle)**: Set the 'Include Owners' toggle to control whether to include owners to the ingested entity if the owner email matches with a user stored in the OM server as part of metadata ingestion. If the ingested entity already exists and has an owner, the owner will not be overwritten.
- **Include Tags (toggle)**: Set the 'Include Tags' toggle to control whether to include tags in metadata ingestion.
- **Include Data Models (toggle)**: Set the 'Include Data Models' toggle to control whether to include tags as part of metadata ingestion.

{% stepDescription title="8. Schedule the Ingestion and Deploy" %}

Scheduling can be set up at an hourly, daily, weekly, or manual cadence. The
timezone is in UTC. Select a Start Date to schedule for ingestion. It is
optional to add an End Date.

Review your configuration settings. If they match what you intended,
click Deploy to create the service and schedule metadata ingestion.

If something doesn't look right, click the Back button to return to the
appropriate step and change the settings as needed.

After configuring the workflow, you can click on Deploy to create the
pipeline.

## Troubleshooting

 ### Workflow Deployment Error

If there were any errors during the workflow deployment process, the
Ingestion Pipeline Entity will still be created, but no workflow will be
present in the Ingestion container.

- You can then edit the Ingestion Pipeline and Deploy it again.

- From the Connection tab, you can also Edit the Service if needed.
